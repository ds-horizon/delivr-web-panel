- pnpm 10.17.0+ (managed by corepack)

### Installation & Development

```bash
# Install and enable corepack (required for proper pnpm version management)
npm install -g corepack
corepack enable

# Install pnpm (if not already installed)
npm install -g pnpm

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Set up environment variables
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your configuration values
```

### Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:
**Required Configuration:**
- **GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID/SECRET**: From Google Cloud Console OAuth setup
- **DELIVR_BACKEND_URL**: URL of your local Delivr Backend server

```bash

# Google OAuth Configuration
GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID=your-google-oauth-client-id.apps.googleusercontent.com
GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET=your-google-oauth-client-secret

# Backend API Configuration  
DELIVR_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3010

```



### Backend Setup
Before running the dashboard, you'll need the Delivr Backend running locally.

📖 **[Backend Setup Guide](https://github.com/your-org/delivr-backend/blob/main/README.md)** - Follow the server documentation to run the backend locally.

### Start Development

```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

The app will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

### Production Build

```bash
# Build for production
pnpm build

# Start production server
pnpm start
```

### Additional Commands

```bash
# Run tests
pnpm test

# Run linting
pnpm lint

# Type checking
pnpm typecheck

# Generate routes and config
pnpm gen:routes && pnpm gen:config
```

## 📱 How to Use Delivr

### 🎯 What You Can Do

**Deploy your mobile apps effortlessly** - Push updates to users without app store delays. Perfect for React Native apps.

### 🚀 Getting Started (5 Minutes)

#### Step 1: Install Delivr SDK in Your Mobile App

Integrate the SDK into your app to enable over-the-air updates. 
// sdk docs link

#### Step 2: Set Up Your Dashboard Account
- Sign in with your Google account
- Create your organization (company workspace)
- Create your first app inside the organization
- Generate deployment keys for your app

#### Step 3: Configure Your App with Deployment Keys
- Copy the deployment keys from the dashboard
- **Important**: Burn these keys into your mobile app code
- Release your app to App Store/Play Store with the embedded keys
- Now you're ready to send CodePush updates!

#### Step 4: Deploy Updates
You can send CodePush updates in two ways:
- **Web Dashboard**: Upload and deploy directly through this interface
- **Delivr CLI**: Deploy from your terminal/CI pipeline // CI docs link

The dashboard shows **all deployments** regardless of how they were sent.

### 📋 Common Workflows

#### 🔄 **Deploying a New CodePush Update**
```
Your workflow: Code → Build → Upload to Delivr → Deploy
```
1. **Make Changes**: Update your React Native code (JS/assets only)
2. **Choose Deployment Method**:
   - **Web Dashboard**: Upload bundle directly through the UI
   - **CLI**: Use  command from your build pipeline // Ci docs link
3. **Target Deployment**: Select which deployment key to push to
4. **Monitor**: Track and update adoption and rollout progress in the dashboard


#### 🔧 **Managing Multiple Deployment Keys**
- **Staging Deployment**: For internal testing and QA
- **Production Deployment**: Live updates to end users



Each deployment key represents a different update channel for your app.

### 🔧 Advanced Features

#### **Deployment Control Options**
- **🔒 Mandatory Updates**: Force users to install critical updates before app usage
- **⏸️ Disabled Updates**: Temporarily pause deployments without rollback
- **📊 Gradual Rollouts**: Control release percentage to manage risk (e.g., 10% → 50% → 100%)
- **🎯 Conditional Releases**: Target specific app versions, OS versions, or user segments

#### **Versioning**
- **📦 Binary Compatibility**: Updates only work with compatible native app versions
- **📱 Multi-Version Support**: Different updates for different base app versions
- **🔗 Version Targeting**: Deploy specific updates to specific app version ranges


#### **Patching**
- **🔄 Delta Patching**: Efficient downloads by sending only diff between two bundles
- **🏷️ Patch-Tagged Releases**: When you see "patch" tagged releases in dashboard, it means a bundle diff patch was sent
- **⚠️ CLI-Only Patches**: Patch releases can only be created via CLI, not web dashboard
- **🛡️ Automatic Fallbacks**: Revert to previous version if update fails


#### **Analytics & Monitoring**
- **📈 Adoption Metrics**: Real-time install rates and user adoption tracking
- **🚨 Error Reporting**: Monitor update failures and crash rates
- **⏱️ Performance Data**: Download times and success rates by region
- **📊 Version Distribution**: See which versions your users are running

### 💡 Key Benefits

- **⚡ Instant Updates**: Deploy bug fixes and features without waiting for app store approval
- **🎯 Targeted Releases**: Deploy to specific user segments or regions
- **🔄 Easy Rollbacks**: Instantly revert to previous versions if issues arise
- **📊 Real-time Monitoring**: See deployment progress and success rates live
- **🔒 Secure**: Enterprise-grade security with role-based team access

### ❓ Common Questions

**Q: What are deployment keys?**  
A: Secure tokens linked to your app that identify where CodePush updates should be delivered. You generate them in the dashboard, burn them into your app code, and use them to target deployments.

**Q: Do I need to update my app in the store every time?**  
A: No! Once you've released your app to the store with Delivr SDK and deployment keys, you can send JavaScript/asset updates instantly via CodePush without store approval.

**Q: Can I deploy from both dashboard and CLI?**  
A: Yes! The web dashboard shows all deployments whether they came from the UI or CLI. Use whatever fits your workflow better.

**Q: What happens if I need to rollback?**  
A: Deploy a previous working version using the same deployment key. Users will receive the rollback update just like any other CodePush.

**Q: How do deployment keys work with app store releases?**  
A: Deployment keys must be "burnt" (hardcoded) into your app during development. When you release to app stores, those keys are embedded. Later CodePush updates use those same keys to identify your app.
