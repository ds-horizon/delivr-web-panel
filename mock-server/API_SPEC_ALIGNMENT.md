## ✅ Database Structure Alignment

### Tables Match Backend Schema

| Backend Table | Mock Table | Status |
|--------------|------------|--------|
| `releases` | ✅ `releases` | Exact match |
| `store_distribution` | ✅ `store_distribution` | Exact match |
| `android_submission_builds` | ✅ `android_submission_builds` | Exact match |
| `ios_submission_builds` | ✅ `ios_submission_builds` | Exact match |

### Foreign Key Relationships

```
✅ releases.id ← store_distribution.releaseId (one-to-one)
✅ store_distribution.id ← android_submission_builds.distributionId (one-to-many)
✅ store_distribution.id ← ios_submission_builds.distributionId (one-to-many)
```

---

## ✅ Critical Feature Coverage

### 1. ✅ Platform Targeting

- **dist_002**: Android-only release
- **dist_003**: iOS-only release
- **dist_001, dist_004, dist_005, dist_006, dist_007**: Both platforms

### 2. ✅ `isActive` / `isCurrent` Flag Logic

| Scenario | Example | `isCurrent` Value |
|----------|---------|-------------------|
| Current PENDING submission | asb_005, isb_004 | ✅ `true` |
| Current IN_REVIEW submission | asb_004_v3_current | ✅ `true` |
| Current APPROVED submission | isb_003 | ✅ `true` |
| Current LIVE submission | asb_001, isb_001 | ✅ `true` |
| Current PAUSED submission | isb_006 | ✅ `true` |
| HALTED submission (terminal) | asb_006 | ✅ `true` |
| Historical REJECTED (after resubmit) | asb_004_v1_rejected | ✅ `false` |
| Historical CANCELLED (after resubmit) | asb_004_v2_cancelled | ✅ `false` |

**✅ 100% aligned with spec:**
- `true` for: PENDING, IN_REVIEW, APPROVED, LIVE, PAUSED, HALTED
- `false` for: REJECTED/CANCELLED *only after* new submission created
- HALTED remains `true` (terminal, cannot resubmit)

### 3. ✅ Multiple Resubmissions (Rejection Flow)

**dist_004 Android** - Complete resubmission history:
1. `asb_004_v1_rejected` - REJECTED (isCurrent: false)
2. `asb_004_v2_cancelled` - CANCELLED (isCurrent: false) 
3. `asb_004_v3_current` - IN_REVIEW (isCurrent: true) ← **Current**

**✅ Tests**: Historical submissions preserved, new submission becomes current

### 4. ✅ Action History

| Submission | Actions Logged | Purpose |
|-----------|----------------|---------|
| asb_004_v2_cancelled | ✅ CANCELLED | User-initiated cancellation with reason |
| asb_006 (HALTED) | ✅ HALTED | Emergency halt with reason |
| isb_006 (PAUSED) | ✅ PAUSED | Phased rollout pause with reason |
| isb_007 | ✅ PAUSED → RESUMED | Multiple actions (pause/resume cycle) |

**✅ Tests**: Audit trail for PAUSED, RESUMED, CANCELLED, HALTED

### 5. ✅ Decimal Rollout Percentages

- **asb_002**: `27.5%` (Android decimal support)
- **asb_006**: `15.3%` (Android decimal support)
- **asb_007**: `99.5%` (Android decimal support)
- **asb_004_v3_current**: `5.5%` (Android initial rollout with decimal)

**✅ Tests**: Android supports decimals (spec: 0-100, supports decimals)

### 6. ✅ iOS Release Types

| Submission | `phasedRelease` | Expected Behavior |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------------|
| isb_001 | ✅ `true` | 7-day phased rollout (can pause/resume, can skip to 100%) |
| isb_003 | ❌ `false` | **Manual release** (immediate 100%, no rollout control) |
| isb_006 | ✅ `true` | Phased rollout (currently PAUSED) |
| isb_007 | ✅ `true` | Phased rollout (LIVE at 25%, has pause/resume history) |

**✅ Tests**: Both phased (automatic) and manual (immediate 100%) releases

### 7. ✅ `inAppUpdatePriority` Values

- asb_001: `0` (default)
- asb_002: `2` (medium priority)
- asb_004_v3_current: `1` (low priority)
- asb_006: `5` (highest priority - critical update)
- asb_007: `3` (high priority)

**✅ Tests**: Full range 0-5 as per spec

### 8. ✅ `resetRating` Flag

- isb_005: `resetRating: true` ← **Only case where rating is reset**
- All others: `resetRating: false`

**✅ Tests**: iOS rating reset feature

### 9. ✅ `releaseType` (Always AFTER_APPROVAL)

- **All iOS submissions**: `releaseType: "AFTER_APPROVAL"`

**✅ Tests**: Per spec, always "AFTER_APPROVAL" (display-only, non-editable)

### 10. ✅ `internalTrackLink` Behavior

- **asb_001**: Has `internalTrackLink` (first submission)
- **asb_002, asb_004_v3_current, asb_006, asb_007**: `null` (resubmissions go direct to production)
- **asb_005**: Has `internalTrackLink` (first submission, PENDING)

**✅ Tests**: Internal testing link only for first submission, not resubmissions

---

## ✅ Artifact Structure Alignment

### Android Artifacts

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "artifactPath": "s3://...",
    "internalTrackLink": "..." // Optional, only for first submission
  }
}
```

✅ **Correct**: Artifact nested in submission, not at distribution level

### iOS Artifacts

```json
{
  "artifact": {
    "testflightNumber": 50001
  }
}
```

✅ **Correct**: Artifact nested in submission, not at distribution level

---

## ✅ Empty/Null Field Handling

### PENDING Submissions (dist_005)

- `submittedAt`: `null` ✅
- `submittedBy`: `null` ✅
- `releaseNotes`: `""` (empty string) ✅
- `rolloutPercentage`: `0` ✅
- `actionHistory`: `[]` (empty array) ✅

**✅ Matches spec**: PENDING submissions have null/empty values for submission-related fields
